# Setup Your First React App

**Prerequisites -**You need to have nodejs installed on your machine. If you don’t, please go to [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) and download the latest version. We need this because we use npm \(node package manager\) to manage all the dependencies and packages we use in our project.

There are three approaches to initiate a React project. One is pretty simple and straightforward, the other two are not so simple \(not that complicated either.. \).

* Using _create-react-app_ command
* Building a React app from the scratch. \(including configuration of the server and manually installing all the required dependencies.\)
* Using a React Boilerplate

So let’s go through each and every approach step by step.
