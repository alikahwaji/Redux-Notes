# Benefits of React

  
Every new library or framework claims to be better than its predecessors in some respect. In the beginning, we had jQuery, and it was leaps and bounds better for writing cross-browser code in native JavaScript. If you remember, a single AJAX call taking many lines of code had to account for Internet Explorer and WebKit-like browsers. With jQuery, this takes only a single call: $.ajax\(\), for example. Back in the day, jQuery was called a framework—but not anymore! Now a framework is something bigger and more powerful.

Similarly with Backbone and then Angular, each new generation of JavaScript frameworks has brought something new to the table. React isn’t unique in this. What is new is that React challenges some of the core concepts used by most popular front-end frameworks: for example, the idea that you need to have templates.



The following list highlights some of the benefits of React versus other libraries and frameworks:

* Simpler apps—React has a CBA with pure JavaScript; a declarative style; and powerful, developer-friendly DOMabstractions \(and not just DOM, but also iOS, Android, and so on\).
* Fast UIs—React provides outstanding performance thanks to its virtual DOM and smart-reconciliation algorithm, which, as a side benefit, lets you perform testing without spinning up \(starting\) a headless browser.
* Less code to write—React’s great community and vast ecosystemof components provide developers with a variety of libraries and components. This is important when you’re considering what framework to use for development.
