# Disadvantages of React

Of course, almost everything has its drawbacks. This is true with React, but the full list of cons depends on whom you ask. Some of the differences, like declarative versus imperative, are highly subjective. So, they can be both pros and cons. Here’s my list of React disadvantages \(as with any such list, it may be biased because it’s based on opinions I’ve heard from other developers\):



* React isn’t a full-blown, Swiss Army knife–type of framework. Developers need to pair it with a library like Redux or React Router to achieve functionality comparable to Angular or Ember. This can also be an advantage if you need a minimalistic UI library to integrate with your existing stack.
* React isn’t as mature as other frameworks. React’s core API is still changing, albeit very little after the 0.14 release; the best practices for React \(as well as the ecosystem of components, plug-ins, and add-ons\) are still developing.
* React uses a somewhat new approach to web development, and JSX and Flux \(often used with React as the data library\) can be intimidating to beginners. 
* React only has a one-way binding. Although one-way binding is better for complex apps and removes a lot of complexity, some developers \(especially Angular developers\) who got used to a two-way binding will find themselves writing a bit more code. 
* React isn’t reactive \(as in reactive programming and architecture, which are more event-driven, resilient, and responsive\) out of the box. Developers need to use other tools such as Reactive Extensions \(RxJS, [https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS)\) to compose asynchronous data streams with Observables.
